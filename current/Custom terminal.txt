Terminal (emulator)

The general idea is for a cross platform terminal.  It has full bash support even on windows.  But it is more visaul than a normal terminal.
If a script is pasted into the terminal rather than run it line by line, it makes a new "script block" which holds the script and allows it to be edited.
script blocks can be ran and produce output in their block not the main terminal.
even single commands run in script blocks.
blocks have a rerun button but will retain their previous results if not reran
if up arrow, make new block based on previous one, prefix optional, substring optional
blocks automatically run in the background of the terminal
blocks can be set to scrollable or non scrollable (per block and global default)
A better system for variables, escaped symbols, and pipes.
supports other script languages nativly in script blocks with configurable header
by default auto imports terminal tools
blocks support finish notifications
explorer like interface
basic api for interactable command outputs
supports normal copy paste
command blocks have stop button
long clicking stop button force stops the tasks like closing the terminal would.  no asking, no stalling, just kill it
auto detects paths in commands.  if a path appears and exists, puts a thumbnail of the thing next to it.  optionally visually shortens paths

Special commnands
ssh 
- forms normal ssh connection with server, but emulates script blocks.  (possibly using screen, or maybe just pipes and files)
- Ideally only prompt 2fa on koa once
- Inputs are handled locally until sent
- Other special commands are extracted and only the appropriate command to get needed data are ran remote

monitor [file]
- displays the file updating when changed.  Options to scroll to end of file or mantain current line

open [file] 
- opens the file inferring how from its header.  text goes to edit command, other supported to display

display [file]
- designed for image and video files
- embeds image file in terminal
- plays gifs
- various scale options (fill width, fill height, scroll, etc)

play [file]
- video files go to display
- audio files have a play bar

ils
- interactive ls, shows explorer like file view including thumbnails, can be list or grid.  
- can sort by anything post facto
- clicking a folder navigates into it.  middle clicking opens folder in new block
- clidking files opens them
- clicking the path specifically copies it
