This app for android will have a share file hook for image files
When an image is shared it will take the image and down sample/compress/scale the image until is is under 8mb and automatically share with the discord app
Add settings for max compression, min size (width and height) and an option to use discord nitro file limit instead of base limit
Also add manual crop option if compression not possible
Preferably add support for mp4/gif files as well
