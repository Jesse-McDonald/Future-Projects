a redundant NAS for a home server, the nas must support 
* multiple parody disks for data redundancy on ALL disks
* hotspares
* mixed disk sizes
* partly initilized disks
* adding new disks to an existing array
* load balancing data accross all disks
* if a disk fails, AND the parody fails, only the data stored on THAT DISK is lost
