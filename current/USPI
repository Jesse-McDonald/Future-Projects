Goal
USPI is a project to create a device that can act as both a USB client and a USB host at the same time.  Not on the same port obviously.
The purpose is so that someone can connect a usb device to one side and write a program to programicaly modify the usb signal before acting as a device.
Obviously this scope is quite large so the specific use case is to make a device that a HID device can be attatched to (Steam controller specificaly) and programicaly create a USB HID device (Ie. regular xbox controller) before exporting to a computer
This should allow for complex controller remappings far beyond valves limited scope including such wonderfull things as using the touch pads as both joysticks and 8 way d-pads at the same time
(Map, x/y to joystick, clicks at the edge to d-pad, clicks in center to joystick clicks)

Current Plan
Use 2 Raspbery Pi 0's, (well ok, 1 raspbery pi 0, 1 raspbery pi 0 w)
The 0 is configured to run as usb host and controller is pluged directly in.  A usb hub and usb-ethernet adapter is used to ssh into this device
Use USBIP http://usbip.sourceforge.net/ to forward the USBs connected (or just the first HID?) over a virtual ethernet port using the PI0's serial0 bus
The 0w is configred to run as USB client and recives controller input via usbIP over serial0 bus.  Ssh into this device via onboard wifi.
The 0w then translates then reads the controller inputs and creates a USB output based on an internal script

Stall
Awaiting ethernet cable to connect PI with (Hopefully Friday)
