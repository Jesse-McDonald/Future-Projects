C++ is great, but its not perfect.  I seek to improve on c++

Features
  c++ basic syntax
  Java style class syntax (its all in class name{foo(){}} none of this name::foo(){} nonesense)
  only 1 type of sorce file, no h file (h files are generated compile time so even though we include doc.src, c++ compiler will get include doc.h and compile doc.cpp)
  circular includes auto resolve with forward define
  include guards automatic
  files automaticaly include own H file, function order does not matter.
  compiler has run interprited mode
  
  Pointers
    All heap allocated pointers use shared_ptr unless explicitly the user doesnt allow it
    local_ptr is a raw pointer for local use only.  Can not be return, can not be class level variables
    local_ptr is automaticaly used when conditions are met 

  Structs/classes
    multiple inheritance is definitly a thing (fix diamond problem by constructing single inheritance path at compile time)
    Add function injecting (I want std::String to have a .toMyClass function so as part of MyClass I inject a function into String (injected functions still have public access rights)) (probiably use old class:: stuff for this) 
    Structs can no longer contain any non operator public functions
    Add operator for casts
    Read/Write of class variables individualy access controlled (ie public readable private writeable is totaly a thing (usefull for string.length), as is public writable private readable (usefull for rand.seed))
    

  Data structures
    Array's track own length
    JSON added as type
    JSON type objects support JSON syntax (ie, none of this object.getInt("x") nonesense, object.x returns an appropriate type depending on caller expectation)
    Add Worker theads class
      an other thread can request a worker thread run a function
      Worker thread sleeps if no requests
    


Plan
Transompile to c++ then hand off c++ to compiler.
Be cross platform be allowing compilation to different c++ compilers
(ie include Windows.h vs including unistd.h)
Full c++ library compatability via transcompiling to c++ then including library


Stall not sure where to start
