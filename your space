would be my space but thats already in use\
new "social network"\
each person is given a virtual area in a 2D* space (actual shape of the space may be weird)\
You can do whatever you like with your virtual area, but anything you do has to fit within the area\
You can buy more area.\
The only way to get to another area is to move through the space.  This encourages people to mingle\
Automatic (ish) proximity voice while moving. \
you can control who can hear you (current room, current area, or no one)\
This should allow a virtual mixing area of people.\
You can not control where your space physicaly is in space.
